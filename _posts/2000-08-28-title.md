Let's change the _config.yml so it's a perfect fit for your new blog. First, we need to use a blog-ready theme. For this activity, we will use a theme named minima.

    Navigate to the Code tab of this repository, and browse to the _config.yml file, or click this link here.
    In the upper right corner, click ✏️ to open the file editor.
    Add a theme: set to minima so it shows in the _config.yml file as below:

    theme: minima

    Modify the other configuration variables such as title:, author:, and description: to customize your site.
